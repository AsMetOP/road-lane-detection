# 🚗 Road Lane Detection

A deep learning-based lane detection system using OpenCV and PyTorch. This project aims to identify and track road lanes in real-time using camera input or video files.

# 🧠 Why Road Lane Detection?
Road lane detection is a critical component in the development of intelligent transportation systems and autonomous vehicles. It plays a vital role in enhancing road safety and enabling driver-assist technologies. Here’s why it matters:

🚗 Foundation of Autonomous Driving: Lane detection is a fundamental task for self-driving cars to understand road boundaries and safely navigate through lanes without human intervention.

🛣️ Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS): It is a core part of features like Lane Departure Warning (LDW), Lane Keeping Assist (LKA), and adaptive cruise control — all of which contribute to reducing human error.

🔍 Real-time Decision Making: Detecting lanes accurately in real-time helps vehicles make smarter decisions such as maintaining lanes, performing lane changes, and avoiding collisions.

🌐 Wide Applications: Besides autonomous cars, lane detection is useful in traffic monitoring, augmented reality navigation systems, and smart city infrastructure for traffic flow analysis.

🎯 Computer Vision in Action: This project showcases how computer vision and image processing techniques can be applied to solve real-world challenges using only a camera and code — no expensive sensors required.

By combining OpenCV with efficient algorithms, this project demonstrates how deep learning isn’t always a must — traditional techniques can still deliver strong results in controlled environments.
